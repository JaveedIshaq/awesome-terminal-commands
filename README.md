## ` ps ax | grep httpd`

The command ps ax | grep httpd is a Unix/Linux command that lists all running processes on the system and searches for any process whose name matches the keyword "httpd".

- ps stands for "process status" and is used to display information about running processes.
- ax is an option that tells "ps" to list all running processes from all users, rather than just the processes of the current user.
- | is a pipe operator that takes the output of the ps command and sends it as input to the next command.
- grep is a command that searches for a specific pattern in a text file or output.
httpd is the pattern being searched for in this case.

The overall command `ps ax | grep httpd` lists all running processes and searches for any process whose name contains "httpd". This is often used to check whether the Apache web server is currently running on a Unix/Linux system. If there is a running process with the name "httpd", it will be listed in the output along with its process ID (PID) and other information. If there is no running process with the name "httpd", the output will only show the "grep httpd" process itself.

## `brew services list`

The command `brew services list` is a Homebrew command that lists all services managed by Homebrew on your system along with their current status.

In the output you provided:

httpd is a service that is installed but not currently running. The none status indicates that it is not currently being managed by Homebrew.
php is a service that is currently running and was started by Homebrew. The started status indicates that it is currently active.
php@8.1 is a service that is installed but not currently running. The none status indicates that it is not currently being managed by Homebrew.
The User column shows the user account under which the service is running, and the File column shows the launch agent file that Homebrew uses to manage the service.

Overall, brew services list is a useful command for managing services on your system and ensuring they are running as expected.
